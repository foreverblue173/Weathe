Sorry hailey i don't really feel like making a full readme file rn but these are the required packages to run this:

- pip install keyboard
- pip install selenium
- pip install pillow
- pip install pygame 

fullscreen doesn't really work yet but i'll add it in the future. Updates shouldn't be as bad in the future once you get selenium working

I updated the file so you shouldn't need to change any code outside of the config file

You only need to run webcamPlayer.py, i'll probably adjust this later to make it work in main instead

I will also eventually add an option to watch 4 random cameras at once

Sometimes the program is just not able to find direct links to cameras. This could either be due to the camera being offline or the webpage might just be loading slowly.
Once loading. The program will only cycle through cameras it found a direct link for.
